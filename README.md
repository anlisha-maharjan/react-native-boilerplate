## About The App
The project is a React Native boilerplate (for Android) that provides an architecture optimized for building solid cross-platform mobile applications with embedded authentication flow to help you kickstart new app.

When starting new apps I found myself repeatedly setting up my project with same packages over and over again so I decided to automate this process.

While this mostly consists of how I organize my projects but can be easily extended to suit any workflow.
